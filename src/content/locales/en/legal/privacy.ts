      title: "1. Who We Are and Scope",
      body: [
        "This website (e.g. infinitedrive.xyz and associated domains) is part of the Infinite Drive ecosystem—sovereign infrastructure including the Infinite Improbability Drive blockchain, the BabelFish Network, and related protocols. The project is associated with Deep Thought Labs (deep-thought.computer). This policy applies to your use of this informational website. When you run blockchain nodes or use Drive-managed services, your data remains on your own system as described in the official documentation; that architecture is designed so that we do not collect or control your node or key data.",
        "What we offer: Our site and the tools or sites linked to it are designed so that you can use the technology to create your own resources, projects, and web ecosystems—for example your own websites, platforms, or internet protocols. We provide the tools and the possibility to interact with sovereign infrastructure; you have full discretion over how you use them and what you build. We are committed to the common good, to supporting users, and to preventing misuse of these tools where we can; nevertheless, it is each user's responsibility to use the technology in a lawful and responsible manner.",

      title: "2. Blockchain and On-Chain Data",
      body: [
        "Data recorded on the Infinite Improbability Drive blockchain—as with any public blockchain—is immutable and decentralized. Once written, it cannot be altered or erased by us or by any single party. This is by design: the chain is a neutral, censorship-resistant structure. We do not control, delete, or modify on-chain data.",
        "Our role is limited to providing the tools and infrastructure that allow users to interact with the technology. We do not decide what data you submit to the network or how you use the protocols. You are responsible for what information or data you publish, transact with, or make available on-chain or through ecosystem protocols. We encourage you to understand the public and permanent nature of blockchain data before you use it.",

If we introduce analytics or optional features that process personal data in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, ask for your consent.",
        "Ecosystem services: When you use the blockchain, run nodes via Drive, or interact with decentralized protocols, keys and node data stay under your control on your device. The documentation states that \"all persistent data created by Drive services remains on your system and is never shared.\" We do not collect or store your keys, mnemonics, or node data.",
